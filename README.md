This repo contains all the files I found in the ece362 folder on my Google Drive. I don't think it contains all the files from all the labs I did (because they were stored on Purdue's internal network), but it might. It is worth noting that all the labs were done using CodeWarrior.

The people I worked with on the final project were:
	John Mahony (jpmahonyiv@gmail.com)
	Trevor Bonesteel (tjbonesteel@gmail.com)
	Ayman Alkhalaf (aymanaalkhalaf@gmail.com)
