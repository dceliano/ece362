This repo contains all the files from my work in ECE362 at Purdue.

It is worth noting that all the labs were done using CodeWarrior (for the assembly and C files) and ispLEVER for ABEL files (.abl), which are similar to VHDL or Verilog files.

The people I worked with on the final project were:
	John Mahony (jpmahonyiv@gmail.com)
	Trevor Bonesteel (tjbonesteel@gmail.com)
	Ayman Alkhalaf (aymanaalkhalaf@gmail.com)
